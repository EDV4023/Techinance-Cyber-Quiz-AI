## Inspiration
Often during school we would attend cybersecurity assemblies that rarely remained in our memories. We wanted to create a more interactive and gamified software that makes learning about digital safety more enjoyable.
## What it does
Cyber-Quiz AI provides an infinite amount of cybersecurity related questions so that students are constantly learning. Adjustable difficulties foster a broader range of abilities. 
## How we built it
The website was built in python. The frontend was a multipage Streamlit website and the backend consisted of Google's Genai API, and a .txt file for a user database of scores. 
## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges that we encountered was the management of a database as well as frontend to backend issues. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Implementing AI to randomly generate questions in specific formatting.
## What we learned
We learned more on UI elements and the application of generative AI.
## What's next for Cyber-Quiz AI
We hope that we can add more game-like features to Cyber-Quiz, improve our score database and properly add a leaderboard system.
